<h2>Explanation</h2>

    Imports:
        random: To generate random choices.
        string: To access predefined sets of characters (lowercase, uppercase, digits, and punctuation).

    generate_password Function:
        Takes parameters for the desired length of the password and whether to include uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
        Defines character sets for lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.
        Combines these sets based on user preferences.
        Ensures the generated password contains at least one character from each selected set.
        Fills the rest of the password length with random characters from the combined set.
        Shuffles the password list to avoid predictable sequences and returns the password as a string.

    main Function:
        Prompts the user to input the desired length of the password and checks if it's a valid number.
        Prompts the user to specify character type preferences (uppercase letters, digits, special characters).
        Calls generate_password with the specified length and preferences.
        Displays the generated password.
